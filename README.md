# hive_query_results_on_map
Display geospatial data (lat, lon) from hive query and display on map by using AngularJS and leaflet

Use Spark, AngularJS and Leaflet to display Hive query from spark-sql and display the lat and lon on map

Additional notes:
Can use helium-volume-leaflet but Zeppelin 0.8 or above is required. HDP 2.6.4 comes with Zeppelin 0.7.3.
